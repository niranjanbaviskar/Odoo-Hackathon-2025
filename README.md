## 🚀 Getting Started

 ## AI Fallback System

 The project includes a robust AI fallback system to handle service disruptions and rate limiting, ensuring reliability for AI-powered features.

 ### Features
 - **Fallback AI Models**: Uses GROQ as the primary service and OpenAI as fallback for quiz generation, PDF chat, and language tutor features.
 - **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff for retries (configured via `VITE_AI_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`).
 - **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents repeated calls to failing services (`src/services/circuitBreaker.ts`).
 - **Graceful Degradation**: Provides dynamic mock responses (`src/services/mockAI.ts`) when both primary and fallback services fail.
 - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays AI service health (feature, provider, duration, status, error) on the admin dashboard (`/admin`) using Supabase Realtime (`src/components/MonitoringDashboard.tsx`).
 - **Access Control**: Restricts the admin dashboard to users with the `admin` role (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`).
 
 ## 📬 Contact Form Mailing Service 
 - **Contact Form**: Users can send messages directly to the developer via the contact form on the website.
 - **Nodemailer Integration**: The backend uses [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) to send emails from the contact form to the developer's email address.
 - **Environment Variables**: Email credentials and recipient addresses are securely managed using environment variables in the `.env` file:
 - `test_dev_mail_id` – SMTP sender email address
 - `test_dev_mail_password` – SMTP app password (for Gmail, use an App Password)
 - `devs_mail_id` – Developer's recipient email address
 - **Backend API**: The mailing service is exposed at `POST /api/contact` (see `contact_api.cjs`). The frontend form submits user data to this endpoint.
 - **Security**: Sensitive credentials are never exposed in frontend code.

 
### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)
- Docker Desktop (for local development)
- Supabase CLI (`npm install -g supabase`)
- Supabase account
- GROQ API key
- Bhashini API key

### 🔐 OAuth Setup (Google & GitHub)

1. Create your own Supabase project.
2. Go to `Authentication → Providers` in Supabase dashboard.
3. Enable **Google** and **GitHub**, and provide Client ID/Secret.




### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarinagarwal/learnify.git
cd learnify
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
    npm install express cors nodemailer dotenv
```

3. Install Supabase CLI

```bash
npm i supabase --save-dev
```

4. Start Supabase Locally

```bash
npx supabase start
```

5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
TRANSLATION_BHASHINI_API_KEY=your_bhshini_api_key
test_dev_mail_id=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
test_dev_mail_password=your_gmail_app_password
devs_mail_id=developer_recipient@gmail.com
```

4. Start the local Supabase instance:

```bash
supabase start
```

5. Apply database migrations:

```bash
supabase db push
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Start the translation server:

```bash
python ./translation_api.py
```

8. Start the backend mailing API:

```bash
    node contact_api.cjs
```

### Database Setup

For detailed instructions on setting up and working with the database, please refer to our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#database-setup).

Key points:

- Local development uses Docker and Supabase CLI
- Migrations are stored in `/supabase/migrations`
- Follow migration guidelines when making database changes
- Test all changes locally before committing
